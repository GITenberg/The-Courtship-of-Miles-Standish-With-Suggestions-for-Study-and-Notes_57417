<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.</h2></div>


<p>&#8220;The Courtship of Miles Standish&#8221; deals with a
supreme moment in the history of our nation, the moment
when the harassed and thrice-winnowed little band of
Puritans began to establish themselves and their institutions
on these shores. In the belief that the poem will
be better understood and appreciated both as poetry and
as history if some of the traits and the struggles of this
people are called to mind, a few words regarding them
will here be given.</p>

<p>Though the sovereigns of England under whose auspices
the movement known as the Reformation was carried
through, severed connection with the Church of Rome,
they did not bring about a thorough reform in matters of
faith and church service. Hence there arose in England
parties holding conflicting views regarding the correctness
and propriety of the practices and ceremonies still in
vogue. The Established Church still retained much that,
in the opinion of the more radical element, should be removed.
These differences of opinion exhibited various
degrees of radicalism and conservatism. Those who were
unwilling to conform to the regulations of the Church of
England were styled &#8220;Non-conformists,&#8221; and, on account
of their efforts in the direction of further purification, they
became known as &#8220;Puritans.&#8221; There were still others
who believed in carrying the reform so far as to separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the church from the state, and to reach independence in
church government: these were the &#8220;Independents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Established Church was supported by secular authority,
so that in all disputes it had on its side the king
and the arm of the law. In many cases it exercised its
power in bitter persecution of those who showed a tendency
to depart from its teachings. The Puritans were, as
one historian says, &#8220;pursued into their hiding-places with
relentless fury,&#8221; so that many individuals sought voluntary
exile, and whole assemblages looked for some place in
far countries where they could worship according to conscience
and to the light they found in the Bible.</p>

<p>Such a party of persecuted Puritans chose as leaders
one of their ministers, John Robinson, and their ruling
elder, William Brewster, and resolved to seek refuge and
religious liberty in Holland. This country was selected on
account of its friendly attitude towards Calvinism, a
view which harmonized with those of the Puritans; and
also on account of the near relations which England as
an ally of Holland sustained to this country.</p>

<p>Their first attempt at leaving England (1607) was anticipated
and prevented by the magistrates; but the following
spring they made a second attempt, which was so
far successful that the officers of the crown succeeded only
in seizing and detaining some helpless women and children.
These were, however, later on set at liberty and permitted
to embark. At first these Pilgrims, as they came to be
called, settled in Amsterdam, but in 1609 they removed to
Leyden, where their number was constantly increased by
new arrivals from England. In Holland, though they
gained the confidence and respect of the Dutch, their condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
was not entirely satisfactory. Brought up as tillers
of the soil, they could not become entirely reconciled to
the trades and handicrafts which they were now necessitated
to learn. Moreover, they felt that the Dutch language
could not become a homelike speech to them. There
was also, deep in their hearts, a devout patriotism, which
first led them to think of establishing themselves in some
of the colonies under English rule.</p>

<p>The first step, they saw, was to decide on a suitable
locality in the New World. After making such investigations
as they could, they planned to locate in the territory
which King James granted to the Plymouth Company in
1606. But before they were ready to embark, two other
grave problems confronted them, and it took years before
these were solved.</p>

<p>Would they in the king&#8217;s dominions be allowed religious
freedom and be undisturbed in their worship? Representatives
of their congregation visited England for the purpose
of trying to get the king&#8217;s guarantee to this effect.
In presenting their request they stated they were willing
to promise &#8220;obedience in all things, active if the thing
commanded be not against God&#8217;s word, or passive if it be.&#8221;
They were disappointed of obtaining the pledge they
sought; and left with nothing more encouraging or definite
than an assurance that so long as they gave no offense
they should not be disturbed.</p>

<p>The other problem was that of finding the means necessary
for the enterprise. After lengthy negotiations,
during which several propositions were rejected as impracticable,
they formed a compact with some London
merchants that had become interested in the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
fisheries. These merchants, in return for services to be
rendered by the Pilgrims, furnished money for the passage,
stipulating that all profits were to be &#8220;reserved till the
end of seven years, when the whole amount, and all lands
and fields, were to be divided among the share-holders
according to their respective interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two vessels that had been provided could not carry
the entire congregation, and so it was determined that
&#8220;the youngest and strongest who freely offered themselves&#8221;
should leave. Their head and leader was Brewster, the
governing elder. Robinson, the spiritual elder, it was decided,
should follow later with the others if the reports
were favorable.</p>

<p>After solemn fasts and worship, in which they invoked
the blessing of God and commended themselves to his
guidance, the Pilgrims set sail from Holland. They
touched at Southampton, England, and a fortnight later
started westward for the shores of America. The two
vessels on which they were embarked were the <i>Speedwell</i>,
of sixty tons burden, and the <i>Mayflower</i>, of one hundred
and eighty tons. After some distance at sea, the Speedwell
was found to leak, and they were compelled to return
to port at Dartmouth for repairs. After a delay of a
week they were again under way, and once more the captain
of the Speedwell signaled distress, claiming that his
vessel was not in a <i>seaworthy</i> condition. This necessitated
their return to Plymouth; the Speedwell was abandoned,
and such of her passengers as could be accommodated were
transferred to the Mayflower.</p>

<p>On the sixth day of September, 1620, the Mayflower
with one hundred and two passengers besides her crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
started alone. After a voyage of over two months they
hove in sight of the sandy shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
Filled with the responsibility of their enterprise,
they met in the cabin, drafted and signed the following
solemn compact before going on shore:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;In the name of God, Amen. We whose names are here
underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign,
King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France,
and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc., having undertaken,
for the glory of God and advancement of the
Christian faith, and honor of our king and country, a voyage
to plant the first colony in the northern part of Virginia,
do, by these presents, solemnly and mutually, in the
presence of God and of one another, covenant and combine
ourselves together into a civil body politic for our better
ordering and preservation, and in the furtherance of the
ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute
and frame just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions,
and offices, from time to time as shall be thought
most meet and convenient for the general good of the
colony; unto which we promise all due submission and
obedience.</p>

<p>&#8220;In witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our
names at Cape Cod, the 11th of November, in the year
of the reign of our sovereign lord, King James, of England,
France, and Ireland, the eighteenth, and of Scotland the
fifty-fourth, <i>Anno Domini</i> 1620.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In order still further to perfect the arrangements for
governing the colony, they unanimously chose John Carver
as their governor for one year.</p>

<p>The season was already far advanced, so that it was
about the middle of November before they had begun to
explore the coast or to choose a place for the settlement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
As the shallop was found to be in need of repair, Captain
Miles Standish, Bradford and others, determined to explore
the country by land. Their first attempts to &#8220;spy
the country&#8221; were made during exceedingly severe weather.
&#8220;It snowed and did blow all night, and froze withal.&#8221;
Nothing of an encouraging nature could be found along
the beach nor on the fields, which now lay half a foot
thick with snow. A heap of maize which had been concealed
by the Indians was discovered. It was a welcome
find, as it helped to eke out the scanty stores of the Pilgrims.
It must be added that, though Miles Standish took
this, he scrupulously resolved to pay the owners as soon
as they could be found; and six months later he found an
opportunity to render payment.</p>

<p>On December 8, shortly after their morning prayers
were finished, the party was attacked by a hostile tribe of
the Nausites, &#8220;who knew the English only as kidnappers.&#8221;
Fortunately, the Indians were driven off without doing
any damage to the settlers. The exploring party spent
four weeks in searching for a suitable place. During this
time they suffered greatly from exposure to the rain, snow,
and sleet. Sometimes their garments were frozen stiff
like coats of mail. It was often difficult or impossible to
kindle a fire on the snow-covered fields, where the fuel,
whatever they found, was damp and soggy. At one time,
in the midst of a violent snow-storm, the rudder of the
shallop broke, and also the mast, so that they were in
extreme danger of being dashed to pieces among the breakers.
It was through these severe exposures that many of
them contracted the diseases that carried away such a large
part of them during the first winter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>On December 11th the explorers landed on the historical
spot of Plymouth Rock. The Mayflower, shortly
afterwards, cast anchor in the harbor. The men went on
shore, and set to work to build houses and to provide
shelter against the winter. Their labor was made arduous
by the inclement weather, and by the fact that about one-half
of the settlers were sick, some of them wasting away
with consumption and lung fever.</p>

<p>As protection against the Indians, who were occasionally
seen hovering near, they formed themselves into a
military organization, with Miles Standish as captain.
Their relations with the Indians were, however, so fair
and honest that even these must have observed some singular
differences between the Pilgrims and earlier traders on
the coast. Early in the spring, Samoset, an Indian, visited
them with the view evidently of ascertaining whether
they were disposed to form acquaintance and to establish
friendship with his people. This led to a visit by the
powerful chief <i>Massasoit</i> himself. He was received and
entertained by the Pilgrims in a way that inspired his confidence,
resulting finally in a sort of defensive alliance
between the settlers and his tribe. He later on rendered
valuable services, particularly by giving warning of the
massacre planned by the Narragansetts against the settlers
at Weymouth.</p>

<p>On the fifth of April, 1621, the Mayflower started on
her return voyage to England. Notwithstanding the hardships
suffered by the colonists that first and dreadful winter,
not one of them returned. As spring and summer
came on, conditions improved. The streams abounded
with fish and the forests with game. In the autumn they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
were again visited by Massasoit, and feasted him and
ninety of his men. The Narragansetts alone were not
friendly. Their chief, Canonicus, sent over a bundle of
arrows wrapped in the skin of a rattlesnake, thereby avowing
his intentions of war. Bradford sent back the skin
stuffed with powder and shot; and it appears that this
prompt acceptance of the challenge made the chief hesitate,
for he became willing to sue for peace. This incident,
which Longfellow has used, took place in 1622. Another
incident also used took place the following year. One of
the London merchants, thinking to increase his profits, sent
over sixty unmarried men, who formed a settlement which
they called Weymouth. These people soon found themselves
in want, and intruded for a considerable time upon
the people of Plymouth. They were indolent; they plundered
the Indians, and these formed a plot to destroy the
entire colony. But Massasoit revealed their designs to
the Puritan settlers. These sent a force under the intrepid
Miles Standish, who succeeded in preventing the
calamity.</p>

<p>The Plymouth Colony and its far-reaching results have
been depicted by every writer of American history. This
sketch requires only that we present the general traits of
the people and the merest outline of the incidents that
Longfellow has brought into the poem; it is therefore not
necessary for the present purpose to follow the narrative
further.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;The Courtship of Miles Standish&#8221; was published in
1858. Longfellow has in this poem again made use of
the hexameter; but though it is the same metre as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
&#8220;Evangeline,&#8221; it presents some important differences.
With the purpose of modifying the stern Puritan mood, he
has given the metre a lighter movement, which also harmonizes
with the touches of humor occasionally introduced.
As to the content of the poem, the author has used the facts
and incidents recounted in the old Puritan records, and
faithfully woven them into a true historic picture, a picture
none the less faithful because the poet has slightly
deviated from the annals in the sequence of some events.
Miles Standish, John Alden, and Priscilla are there giving
it reality by acting out the story&mdash;an old human
story; but when these are allowed to drop out of sight,
that which remains is the realization of a people, the
Puritans, a people of indomitable determination and of
uncompromising loyalty to conscience and to God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">HISTORY.</p>


<p>The poem takes immediate hold of the events given in
the early chronicles. The time when the story begins is
stated only in a general way; but as the Mayflower began
her return voyage April 5, 1621, the phrase, &#8220;In the
Old Colony days,&#8221; stands for April 4th of the same year.
The names of the three principal characters are mentioned
in Bradford&#8217;s <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i> as names of
immigrants on the Mayflower. In regard to the instance
of the rattlesnake-skin challenge sent by Canonicus, the
time of its occurrence has been shifted in the poem from
January, 1622, when it really took place, to the date when
the poem opens. The incident is historical, and has been
brought in almost in the exact form in which it is recorded.
The real occasion for the Captain&#8217;s expedition (488)
was to rescue the neighboring settlement of Weymouth,
which was threatened by the Indians in March, 1623. The
chronicles mention the details of the encounter very much
as given (745-815); also the trophy brought back by the
Captain (818, 819). May 12th is mentioned as the date
when the first marriage in the colony took place. The
poet&#8217;s description of the ceremony (936-939) is based
upon Bradford&#8217;s <i>History</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;May 12th was the first mariage in this place, which,
according to ye laudable custome of ye Low Countries, in
which they had lived, was thought most requisite to be performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
by the magistrate, as being a civill thing, upon
which many questions aboute inheritances doe depende,
with other things most proper to their cognizans, and most
consonant to ye Scriptures, Ruth 4, and no wher found in
ye Gospell to be layed on ye ministers as part of their
office.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the main incidents that form the groundwork;
but in addition to these there are numerous minor touches,
names and facts from the old records, all which go to build
up the narrative into a faithful historic picture.</p>

<p>Such is the portrayal of Standish and his previous service
in Holland. He had fought in Flanders (25) against
the Spaniards (28); he had charge of the military organization
in the Colony (46-93). The Indian names mentioned
in 53 are found in the chronicles. The death of
Rose Standish (136) is also mentioned. Other names
and facts that in one way or another are matters of historic
record are the &#8220;Psalm-book of Ainsworth,&#8221; printed in
Amsterdam (231, 232); the seven houses of Plymouth
(392); Wat Tyler (415); the Elder and his Words (442,
443 and 457); Stephen, Richard, and Gilbert (547); the
Field of the First Encounter (606). &#8220;In autumn the
ships of the merchants&#8221; (825)&mdash;this refers to the Anne
and the Little James, which arrived in Plymouth in the
autumn of 1623. &#8220;Still may be seen&#8221; (846): the descendants
of Alden still own the lands where his house
stood, in Duxbury.</p>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>State what you can about the locality where the Pilgrims
landed and settled. Give a description of it as you think
it appeared to the immigrants in December, 1620. Could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
it have been an inviting place? How does this locality look
in the spring, say early in April?</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>State in what way the value of the poem as such would
be changed if it were not connected with a historic event
as momentous as that of the founding of the Plymouth
Colony. What, then, besides the story of the three principal
characters is there in the poem? State, with reasons
for your views, which you regard the more significant,&mdash;the
story as such, or the historic picture it presents.</p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>Find details in the poem that you regard as particularly
faithful to history. Find touches that illustrate historic
statements like this: &#8220;The pioneers [Puritans] were rugged,
strong, and inspired by an unshakable faith in their
mission in the New World.&#8221; (<i>People&#8217;s History of the
United States</i>.) See, for instance, line 599. Point out
several examples of the customs, habits, and views depicted
that are historic in the same way. Quote lines portraying
the religious character of the Puritans; their faith in
their mission. Cite passages depicting the hardships of
the preceding winter. Find strongly visualizing touches
portraying their condition as settlers. Also instances showing
their relations toward the red men.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center">THE ACTION.</p>

<p>The poem presents an artistically finished story, in
which the action begins with a statement of a definite
issue, and moves on through complication and suspenses
to a complete solution. Hence it is well adapted for the
study of plot.</p>

<p>Every carefully constructed story begins with the presentation
of an issue so contrived as to seize upon and
arrest the attention of the reader. Something of momentous
consequence to one or more of the characters is
pending. The interests of the hero or the heroine are
threatened by the interests of other characters. A collision
between two opposing characters is unavoidable. The
hero steps forward and enters upon a career clashing with
the traditions and customs of his surroundings. His ambition
sets up an aim and a purpose that cannot be attained
without the risk of life or fortune. A struggle, at any rate,
is impending and inevitable; and in the first situation
of a well-constructed story the special nature of it is
placed before the reader.</p>

<p>At this point the action begins. It seizes upon the attention
of the reader by causing him to project his thoughts
forward in anticipation of the action completed, the solution
of the problem. As he follows the story his interest
in the struggle is heightened by finding obstacles that
challenge the very best powers of the hero and the heroine,
and test to the utmost their strength and courage. These
obstacles give rise to situations fraught with special points
of interest, rousing curiosity or giving glimpses of character
or the secret workings of the soul which the composure
of ordinary life does not afford. In the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the story there are subtle touches or character hints which
endear the hero to the reader. At this stage it is something
more than a struggle waged between comparatively
unknown forces&mdash;a strong human interest is added, so
that the reader conceives strong wishes and consummations
of his own with reference to the outcome.</p>

<p>In a story there are several positions that determine the
plot and mark the stages of the progress. These form the
basis of its structure; and in the study of the plot they
are very serviceable as points of departure. Thus we may
recognize the point where we have sufficient introductory
data to state the problem, or in other words, to formulate
the issue. At what point do we feel prompted to wish for
any certain kind of result to the struggle? What is the
nature of the obstacles that aggravate and complicate the
struggle? Do they rise subjectively out of the hero&#8217;s character,
or are they brought in through the counterplay of
other characters? At what point and through what occurrences
does the story seem to point to a definite outcome?
Through what means is the reader again led to entertain
doubts and misgivings? In what way is the main problem
solved? Is the struggle ended so that we feel that everything
involved in the issue is fully terminated?</p>

<p>In lines 85 and 86, John Alden&#8217;s hopes and desires are
indicated, and we wonder, How shall he speed, and is the
consummation to be such as he desires? Another step is
reached in 155, where the action is complicated by an
obstacle placed in his way. At this stage we have an
opportunity to note a bit of the writer&#8217;s art if we observe
the effect that this turn of events has. It certainly adds
to the interest. But how? In the first place, we are anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
to know whether this obstacle will, against our wishes,
cause the hopes of Alden to be frustrated. If we are in
doubt as to whether it takes hold of us in this way, we have
but to note that we are not content to leave the story at
this point. In the second place, we are curious to know
how Alden will acquit himself pleading with Priscilla
in behalf of a rival suitor. And again, How will Priscilla
receive the proffers of the Captain? The situation to
which we immediately look forward has many elements
adapted to seize strongly upon the reader&#8217;s attention. It
will primarily be momentous in the fortunes of the principal
characters; and it will, further, have features that
in various other ways interest people. Up to this point
Alden&#8217;s character has been developed in such a way that
we are sure he cannot summarily set aside or ignore his
promise to the Captain. The commission entrusted to him
is bound to create a violent conflict in his mind between
love on one side and friendship and conscience on the
other. This conflict will be visually exhibited in the
coming interview with Priscilla. In whatever way the
interview as such terminates, we see that a series of interesting
consequences must follow from it: as, for instance,
Alden&#8217;s report to the Captain, the mood induced in
the latter, and his subsequent course of action. Again, it
cannot pass without resulting in some sort of counteraction
on the part of the other two, thereby giving rise to
situations that will tax all their loyalty and resourcefulness.</p>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>What assurance have we that Alden will not attempt to
ignore or evade his promise (245-248)? In what way is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the situation made more intense by Priscilla&#8217;s welcome
(251-253)? How does the preliminary conversation increase
the difficulties of Alden&#8217;s errand? In the manner of
delivering his message, is he influenced mainly by a
sense of his obligation to the Captain or by the sentiments
he entertains towards Priscilla? What is the dramatic
effect of his abrupt departure? In what respect was the
interview conclusive? At the close of the situation do we
feel that the difficulties in Alden&#8217;s way are lessened or
increased? How did Alden seem to feel in regard to this?</p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>What part of Alden&#8217;s report was the main cause of the
Captain&#8217;s wrath? Had Alden anticipated the effect that
his report would have? How does the arrival of the messenger
(426) affect the plot? Is the incident of the council
a part of the main action, or merely an episode? Why
was it necessary at this stage that the Captain should be
removed from the presence of the other two (484)? What
personal interests of the various characters are pending or
threatened at this point of the story?</p>

<p>In what way is the central action still in a state of suspense
after the Captain&#8217;s departure? Show how the suspense
is to be accounted for by the disposition and character
of Alden. In what way are the occurrences that take
place during the Captain&#8217;s absence invested with interest
(824-900)?</p>


<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p>What is the decisive moment in the story? Explain the
effect it will be likely to have on Alden and his course of
action. In what way is the preceding situation a preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
for this moment? How does the poet make plain to
us Alden&#8217;s previous sense of restraint as well as his present
sense of freedom?</p>


<p class="center">V.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of the information given in 949&mdash;&#8220;Long
had it stood there,&#8221; etc.? What difference would
it have made to one of Alden&#8217;s disposition if the person had
presented himself before the ceremony? Could the action
be regarded as quite complete without the reconciliation
of all the main characters?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="center">THE CHARACTERS.</p>

<p>Miles Standish and John Alden are introduced together,
for the reason, no doubt, that the traits of the one
may serve to set off those of the other. Miles Standish is
a soldier by nature; and a lifetime spent in camp and
field has brought out the soldier spirit in him in all its
completeness. The character of John Alden is less
marked, though it is made sufficiently intelligible, first by
his employment as scribe and correspondent of the colonists,
which leads us to infer that he was better fitted for
the occupation of the scholar than for the struggles of the
pioneer; secondly, his youth and delicate complexion are
mentioned, and we gather that his physique is not robust
nor hardened. The Puritan predominates in John Alden
as the soldier does in Miles Standish. The latter attributes
the saving of his life to the good steel of the breastplate,
while the former attributes it to a direct interposition of
the Lord in slackening the speed of the bullet. We feel that
if Alden had been left to spend an anxious hour or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
alone, he would have turned for consolation to the Bible
and not to &#8220;the ponderous Roman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Captain is a man of strong personality and firm integrity.
He is an organizer of the colony&#8217;s defense; his
voice prevails at the council; he is a resolute and able defender,
who rises equal to emergencies of sudden and imminent
danger. He is also capable of entertaining sentiments
of tenderness (58-60) and magnanimity (949-973).
Yet the author has indicated that, in the conventional sense,
he is not to be taken as the hero. The personal description
of him (11) points to this; so also his almost ludicrous
inconsistency (36-115 and 163-168). His avowed affection
for Priscilla could not have struck deep roots in his
heart, for only two or three months have passed since he
sustained the loss that made his life &#8220;weary and dreary&#8221;
(36). Moreover, this matter could not have been upper-most
in his mind very long, for he would then have
observed that Alden had frequently gone on a lover&#8217;s
errand in his own behalf (252-258). Neither could his
inclinations have been very ardent, for while Alden is
gone he spends the hours without anxiety, absorbed in the
campaigns of Cæsar. He misunderstands and underestimates
the sterling nature of Priscilla when he thinks that
the winning of her is largely and mainly a matter of
phrases (169) and elegant language, &#8220;such as you read
of in books in the pleadings and wooings of lovers.&#8221; All
this helps us to become reconciled to the Captain&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>

<p>John Alden is the most typical Puritan of the leading
characters. His tendency towards a fatalistic view of
life and to self-accusation seem almost too strange to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
accounted for by any doctrine or belief. As a Puritan
he had been brought up and trained in submission to his
elders, which may partly explain his lack of self-assertion.
His position as a dependent in the household of Miles
Standish made him more ready than he otherwise could
have been to go on the Captain&#8217;s delicate errand. There
are situations in which we find Alden insufficient (182,
558, 559). He has little opportunity, in so far that the
part assigned to him is mainly passive. Yet there are possibilities
of stern manhood in him; and, with reference
to the main issue, he is certainly strong in those very
respects where Miles Standish is weak.</p>

<p>Priscilla presents a contrast to the other two. She is
full of healthy, joyous life. Neither the sternness of her
associates nor the hardships of the pioneer life that she
had experienced had been able to detract from her cheerful,
buoyant disposition. During the winter she had become
an orphan, and yet she appears to have been potent
as a ray of sunshine amid the gloom and distress incident
to the condition of the colonists. The fact that she is a
trifle more frank in her conversation with John Alden
than strict conventional form would require detracts nothing,
but rather places her among such ideals of women
as Miranda, Imogen, and Elaine.</p>


<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>In the first eighty lines designate the means used in
describing Miles Standish. Which reveals his character
most effectively&mdash;the author&#8217;s direct description of him,
his talk, his weapons, or his books? Are there any details
in this description that you would like to see altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
if the Captain were to be the hero of the story? The Miles
Standish of history is said to have been thirty-six years
at this time; in what direction has the poet changed his
age? Why?</p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>What position of authority does Standish hold in the
colony? Why has the poet made him and Alden household
companions (15)? What character-contrast in
25-33? Why should the maxim of line 37 be reiterated
(114)? How does the Captain&#8217;s inconsistency (164)
affect the tone of the narrative? Is the reply in 168 to
the point? How does the Captain&#8217;s reliance on phrases
and elegant language change our opinion of him?</p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>How does line 398 square with lines 173, 174? What
had been the Captain&#8217;s state of mind during Alden&#8217;s absence?
What effects measure to us the degree of his
anger after having listened to Alden&#8217;s report? What motives
induced the Captain to start in pursuit of hostile
Indians (486)? Hoes this expedition seem to have been
most likely to insure the safety of the colony? What evidence
have we later on of the Captain&#8217;s magnanimity?
As he is not in the conventional sense the hero of the story,
what purpose, from the point of view of the action, does
he serve?</p>


<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p>In the character portrayal of 1-86, which are the main
points of contrast between Miles Standish and John Alden?
What appears to be the age of Alden? In describing him,
why does the author use more poetic terms (17-20) than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he does in the case of Standish? Was Alden commissioned
by others of the colonists to write letters for them?
What single fact makes clear the sentiments he entertains
towards Priscilla? Had they been acquainted before they
left England?</p>


<p class="center">V.</p>

<p>How can we account for Alden&#8217;s yielding to the Captain&#8217;s
request? What other courses of action were open
to him? &#8220;Then made answer John Alden&#8221; (181)&mdash;continue
here, and in half a dozen lines write the answer
you think he should have made. After leaving the Captain,
what motives hold him to the fulfillment of his
promise (185-248)? Was his blunt manner of delivering
the message (288) deliberate, or was he so overcome that
he could not do it otherwise?</p>


<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p>What exactly is the cause of his distress as told in
339-342? Comment on the frankness of the report he
submits. Should he not have attempted to explain and to
set himself right? Interpret the mood visualized in 558,
559. Does he seem to have a sufficient reason for &#8220;thinking
to fly from despair&#8221; (562)? Would it be a better
story if Alden had been given an opportunity for active
heroism? What in his character is most admirable?</p>


<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p>Did Priscilla belong to those Puritans that had lived
for some years in Holland (269)? What suggestions have
we regarding Priscilla before lines 223-238? In the description
(223-238) what traits are made most prominent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Explain in what respect her disposition seems to be in
sharp contrast to that of Alden (293-338). At what point
and under what conditions does Priscilla&#8217;s influence show
itself most powerful? What do we learn of her from her
words in 667-680? At what point in the story and in
what way is her character most exquisitely drawn? Which
of the three characters had passed through the saddest
experiences since the landing at Plymouth?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">In the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims,</div>
<div class="verse">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather,</div>
<div class="verse">Strode, with martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.</div>
<div class="verse">Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing      <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
<div class="verse">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging in shining array along the walls of his chamber,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Cutlass and corselet of steel, and his trusty sword of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Curved at the point and inscribed with its mystical Arabic sentence,</div>
<div class="verse">While underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket and matchlock.      <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
<div class="verse">Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,</div>
<div class="verse">Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;</div>
<div class="verse">Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.</div>
<div class="verse">Near him was seated John Alden, his friend and household companion,       <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
<div class="verse">Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;</div>
<div class="verse">Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion,</div>
<div class="verse">Having the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the captives</div>
<div class="verse">Whom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, &#8220;Not Angles but Angels.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the Mayflower.       <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Suddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,</div>
<div class="verse">Spake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Look at these arms,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the warlike weapons that hang here</div>
<div class="verse">Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this breastplate,&mdash;<span class="linenum">25</span></div>
<div class="verse">Well I remember the day!&mdash;once saved my life in a skirmish;</div>
<div class="verse">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet</div>
<div class="verse">Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero.</div>
<div class="verse">Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Would at this moment be mold, in their grave in the Flemish morasses.&#8221;     <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;</div>
<div class="verse">He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;        <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
<div class="verse">That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.</div>
<div class="verse">Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;</div>
<div class="verse">So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your inkhorn.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,</div>
<div class="verse">Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,       <span class="linenum">40</span></div>
<div class="verse">Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like Cæsar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams</div>
<div class="verse">Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:      <span class="linenum">45</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Look! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted</div>

<div class="verse">Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.</div>
<div class="verse">Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians:      <span class="linenum">50</span></div>

<div class="verse">Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.</div>
<div class="verse">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,</div>
<div class="verse">Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,</div>
<div class="verse">Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:<span class="linenum">60</span></div>

<div class="verse">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.</div>

<div class="indent">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">Or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Reading the marvelous words and achievements of Julius Cæsar.</div>
<div class="verse">After a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hand, palm downwards,      <span class="linenum">90</span></div>
<div class="verse">Heavily on the page: &#8220;A wonderful man was this Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">You are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow</div>

<div class="verse">Straightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the youthful:</div>

<div class="verse">Somewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate</div>
<div class="verse">Seven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly,&#8221; continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly a wonderful man was this Caius Julius Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;Better be first,&#8217; he said, &#8216;in a little Iberian village,      <span class="linenum">100</span></div>
<div class="verse">Than be second in Rome,&#8217; and I think he was right when he said it.</div>
<div class="verse">Twice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after;</div>
<div class="verse">Battles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he conquered;</div>
<div class="verse">He, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded;</div>
<div class="verse">Finally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!<span class="linenum">105</span></div>
<div class="verse">Now, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders,      </div>
<div class="verse">When the rear guard of his army retreated, the front giving way too,</div>
<div class="verse">And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together</div>
<div class="verse">There was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield from a soldier,</div>
<div class="verse">Put himself straight at the head of his troops, and commanded the captains,      <span class="linenum">110</span></div>
<div class="verse">Calling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons;</div>
<div class="verse">So he won the day, the battle of something-or-other.</div>
<div class="verse">That&#8217;s what I always say; if you wish a thing to be well done,</div>
<div class="verse">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">115</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling</div>
<div class="verse">Writing epistles important to go next day by the Mayflower,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,      <span class="linenum">120</span></div>
<div class="verse">Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret,</div>
<div class="verse">Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">Finally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover,</div>
<div class="verse">Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:      <span class="linenum">125</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell you.</div>
<div class="verse">Be not, however, in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,</div>
<div class="verse">Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,      <span class="linenum">130</span></div>
<div class="verse">Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8217;Tis not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.</div>
<div class="verse">This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;</div>
<div class="verse">Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.      <span class="linenum">135</span></div>
<div class="verse">Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;</div>
<div class="verse">Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.</div>
<div class="verse">She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother</div>
<div class="verse">Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,      <span class="linenum">140</span></div>
<div class="verse">Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying,</div>
<div class="verse">Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever</div>
<div class="verse">There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.<span class="linenum">145</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,</div>
<div class="verse">Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part.</div>
<div class="verse">Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,</div>
<div class="verse">Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.      <span class="linenum">150</span></div>
<div class="verse">Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;</div>
<div class="verse">I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.&#8221;      <span class="linenum">155</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, taciturn stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning,<span class="linenum">160</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Such a message as that, I am sure I should mangle and mar it;</div>
<div class="verse">If you would have it well done,&mdash;I am only repeating your maxim,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose,      <span class="linenum">165</span></div>
<div class="verse">Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing.</div>
<div class="verse">Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,      <span class="linenum">170</span></div>
<div class="verse">But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,</div>
<div class="verse">But of a thundering &#8216;No!&#8217; point-blank from the mouth of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">That, I confess, I&#8217;m afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!</div>
<div class="verse">So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,      <span class="linenum">175</span></div>
<div class="verse">Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Taking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and doubtful,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;</div>
<div class="verse">Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">180</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then made answer John Alden: &#8220;The name of friendship is sacred;</div>
<div class="verse">What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So the strong will prevailed, subduing and molding the gentler,</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,<span class="linenum2">185</span></div>
<div class="verse">Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">Into the tranquil woods, where bluebirds and robins were building</div>
<div class="verse">Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,</div>
<div class="verse">Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom.</div>
<div class="verse">All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,      <span class="linenum">190</span></div>
<div class="verse">Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
<div class="verse">To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,</div>
<div class="verse">As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Must I relinquish it all,&#8221; he cried with a wild lamentation,&mdash;<span class="linenum">195</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?</div>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshiped in silence?</div>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow</div>
<div class="verse">Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption      <span class="linenum">200</span></div>
<div class="verse">Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;</div>
<div class="verse">Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan.</div>
<div class="verse">All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,</div>
<div class="verse">For I have followed too much the heart&#8217;s desires and devices,      <span class="linenum">205</span></div>
<div class="verse">Worshiping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.</div>
<div class="verse">This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shallow,</div>
<div class="verse">Gathering still, as he went, the mayflowers blooming around him,      <span class="linenum">210</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,</div>
<div class="verse">Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Puritan flowers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the type of Puritan maidens,</div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the mayflower of Plymouth,      <span class="linenum">215</span></div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,</div>
<div class="verse">Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,<span class="linenum">220</span></div>
<div class="verse">Sailless, somber and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;      </div>
<div class="verse">Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,</div>
<div class="verse">Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,      <span class="linenum">225</span></div>
<div class="verse">Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift</div>
<div class="verse">Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,</div>
<div class="verse">While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.      <span class="linenum">230</span></div>
<div class="verse">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,</div>
<div class="verse">Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together.</div>
<div class="verse">Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the Avail of a churchyard,</div>
<div class="verse">Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.</div>
<div class="verse">Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,      <span class="linenum">235</span></div>
<div class="verse">She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!</div>
<div class="verse">Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,</div>
<div class="verse">Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;    <span class="linenum">240</span></div>
<div class="verse">All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,</div>
<div class="verse">All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,</div>
<div class="verse">Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces.</div>
<div class="verse">Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Let not him that putteth his hand to the plow look backwards;      <span class="linenum">245</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Though the plowshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,</div>
<div class="verse">Though it pass o&#8217;er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living,</div>
<div class="verse">It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth forever!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So he entered the house; and the hum of the wheel and the singing</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,      <span class="linenum">250</span></div>
<div class="verse">Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, &#8220;I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;</div>
<div class="verse">For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled</div>
<div class="verse">Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,      <span class="linenum">255</span></div>
<div class="verse">Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in the winter,</div>
<div class="verse">After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,</div>
<div class="verse">Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla      <span class="linenum">260</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,</div>
<div class="verse">Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but spoken then, perhaps not in vain had he spoken!</div>
<div class="verse">Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!</div>
<div class="verse">So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.     <span class="linenum">265</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful springtime;</div>
<div class="verse">Talked of their friends at home, and the Mayflower that sailed on the morrow.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have been thinking all day,&#8221; said gently the Puritan maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedgerows of England,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;      <span class="linenum">270</span></div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors</div>
<div class="verse">Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,</div>
<div class="verse">And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy</div>
<div class="verse">Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard.      <span class="linenum">275</span></div>
<div class="verse">Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England.</div>
<div class="verse">You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost</div>
<div class="verse">Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thereupon answered the youth: &#8220;Indeed I do not condemn you; <span class="linenum2">280</span></div>
<div class="verse">Stouter hearts than a woman&#8217;s have quailed in this terrible winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;</div>
<div class="verse">So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage</div>
<div class="verse">Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,&mdash;<span class="linenum2">285</span></div>
<div class="verse">Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,</div>
<div class="verse">But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy;</div>
<div class="verse">Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.</div>
<div class="verse">Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Looked into Alden&#8217;s face, her eyes dilated with wonder,<span class="linenum">290</span></div>
<div class="verse">Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;       </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?</div>
<div class="verse">If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">295</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,</div>
<div class="verse">Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Had no time for such things;&mdash;such things! the words grating harshly</div>
<div class="verse">Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,      <span class="linenum">300</span></div>
<div class="verse">Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?</div>
<div class="verse">That is the way with you men; you don&#8217;t understand us, you cannot.</div>
<div class="verse">When you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one and that one,</div>
<div class="verse">Choosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,</div>
<div class="verse">Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,      <span class="linenum">305</span></div>
<div class="verse">And are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman</div>
<div class="verse">Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Does not attain at a bound to the height to which you have been climbing.</div>
<div class="verse">This is not right nor just; for surely a woman&#8217;s affection</div>
<div class="verse">Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking.      <span class="linenum">310</span></div>
<div class="verse">When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but waited a while, had he only showed that he loved me,</div>
<div class="verse">Even this Captain of yours&mdash;who knows?&mdash;at last might have won me,</div>
<div class="verse">Old and rough as he is; but now it never can happen.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,<span class="linenum2">315</span></div>
<div class="verse">Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,</div>
<div class="verse">How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;</div>
<div class="verse">He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly      <span class="linenum">320</span></div>
<div class="verse">Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,</div>
<div class="verse">Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon.      <span class="linenum">325</span></div>
<div class="verse">He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;</div>
<div class="verse">Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter</div>
<div class="verse">He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman&#8217;s;</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,      <span class="linenum">330</span></div>
<div class="verse">Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;</div>
<div class="verse">For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;</div>
<div class="verse">Any woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language, <span class="linenum2">335</span></div>
<div class="verse">Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,</div>
<div class="verse">Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes overrunning with laughter,</div>
<div class="verse">Said, in a tremulous voice, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak for yourself, John?&#8221;</div>

<div class="verse">Rushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the seaside;      <span class="linenum">340</span></div>
<div class="verse">Paced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Cooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him.</div>
<div class="verse">Slowly, as out of the heavens, with apocalyptical splendors,</div>
<div class="verse">Sank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle;</div>
<div class="verse">So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire,      <span class="linenum">345</span></div>
<div class="verse">Sank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted</div>

<div class="verse">Blowing o&#8217;er fields of dulse, and measureless meadows of seagrass,       <span class="linenum">350</span></div>

<div class="verse">Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing,</div>
<div class="verse">Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the seashore.      <span class="linenum">355</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;</div>
<div class="verse">Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,</div>
<div class="verse">Passionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Is it my fault,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the maiden has chosen between us?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it my fault that he failed,&mdash;my fault that I am the victor?&#8221;      <span class="linenum">360</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It hath displeased the Lord!&#8221;&mdash;and he thought of David&#8217;s transgression,</div>
<div class="verse">Bathsheba&#8217;s beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!</div>
<div class="verse">Shame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,</div>
<div class="verse">Overwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:      <span class="linenum">365</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;It hath displeased the Lord! It is the temptation of Satan!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there</div>
<div class="verse">Dimly the shadowy form of the Mayflower riding at anchor,</div>
<div class="verse">Rocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard the voices of men through the mist, the rattle of cordage      <span class="linenum">370</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Thrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors&#8217; &#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Clear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight.</div>
<div class="verse">Still for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Then went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,</div>
<div class="verse">Stops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning shadow.      <span class="linenum">375</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, it is plain to me now,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;the hand of the Lord is</div>
<div class="verse">Leading me out of the land of darkness, the bondage of error,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,</div>
<div class="verse">Hiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me.</div>
<div class="verse">Back will I go o&#8217;er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,      <span class="linenum">380</span></div>
<div class="verse">Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended.</div>
<div class="verse">Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Close by my mother&#8217;s side, and among the dust of my kindred;</div>
<div class="verse">Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor!</div>
<div class="verse">Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber      <span class="linenum">385</span></div>
<div class="verse">With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,      <span class="linenum">390</span></div>
<div class="verse">Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and somber,</div>
<div class="verse">Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.</div>
<div class="verse">Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain</div>
<div class="verse">Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Cæsar,      <span class="linenum">395</span></div>
<div class="verse">Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Long have you been on your errand,&#8221; he said with a cheery demeanor,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;</div>
<div class="verse">But you have lingered so long, that while you were going and coming      <span class="linenum">400</span></div>
<div class="verse">I have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city.</div>
<div class="verse">Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened.&#8221;</div>
</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure</div>
<div class="verse">From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;</div>
<div class="verse">How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,     <span class="linenum">405</span></div>
<div class="verse">Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal,</div>
<div class="verse">But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,</div>
<div class="verse">Words so tender and cruel: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak for yourself, John?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his armor</div>
<div class="verse">Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen.      <span class="linenum">410</span></div>
<div class="verse">All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,</div>
<div class="verse">E&#8217;en as a hand-grenade, that scatters destruction around it.</div>
<div class="verse">Wildly he shouted, and loud: &#8220;John Alden! you have betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler;      <span class="linenum">415</span></div>
<div class="verse">Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor?</div>
<div class="verse">Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!</div>
<div class="verse">You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;</div>
<div class="verse">You, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I have intrusted my honor, my thoughts the most sacred and secret,&mdash;      <span class="linenum">420</span></div>
<div class="verse">You too, Brutus! ah, woe to the name of friendship hereafter!</div>
<div class="verse">Brutus was Cæsar&#8217;s friend, and you were mine, but henceforward</div>
<div class="verse">Let there be nothing between us save war, and implacable hatred!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his temples.      <span class="linenum">425</span></div>
<div class="verse">But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,</div>
<div class="verse">Rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or parley,</div>
<div class="verse">Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,      <span class="linenum">430</span></div>
<div class="verse">Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden was left alone. He heard the clank of the scabbard</div>
<div class="verse">Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,      <span class="linenum">435</span></div>
<div class="verse">Lifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,</div>
<div class="verse">Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council,</div>
<div class="verse">Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;</div>
<div class="verse">Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,      <span class="linenum">440</span></div>
<div class="verse">Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth.</div>
<div class="verse">God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,</div>
<div class="verse">Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;</div>
<div class="verse">So say the chronicles old, and such is the faith of the people!      <span class="linenum">445</span></div>
<div class="verse">Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,</div>
<div class="verse">Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;</div>
<div class="verse">While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,</div>
<div class="verse">And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered,      <span class="linenum">450</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Filled, like a quiver, with arrows: a signal and challenge of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance.</div>
<div class="verse">This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating</div>
<div class="verse">What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,</div>
<div class="verse">Talking of this and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;      <span class="linenum">455</span></div>
<div class="verse">One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,</div>
<div class="verse">Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,</div>
<div class="verse">Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!</div>
<div class="verse">Then out spake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,      <span class="linenum">460</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted</div>
<div class="verse">There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage</div>
<div class="verse">Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">465</span></div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Not so thought St. Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;</div>
<div class="verse">Not from the cannon&#8217;s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,      <span class="linenum">470</span></div>
<div class="verse">Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.</div>
<div class="verse">War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then from the rattlesnake&#8217;s skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture, <span class="linenum2">475</span></div>
<div class="verse">Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets</div>
<div class="verse">Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, in thundering tones: &#8220;Here, take it! this is your answer!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Bearing the serpent&#8217;s skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,      <span class="linenum">480</span></div>
<div class="verse">Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.</div>

THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Just in the gray of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,</div>
<div class="verse">There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;</div>
<div class="verse">Clanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, &#8220;Forward!&#8221;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Given in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence.      <span class="linenum">485</span></div>
<div class="verse">Figures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village.</div>
<div class="verse">Standish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,</div>
<div class="verse">Led by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.</div>
<div class="verse">Giants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;      <span class="linenum">490</span></div>
<div class="verse">Giants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Aye, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines.</div>
<div class="verse">Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;</div>
<div class="verse">Under them loud on the sands, the serried billows, advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Fired along the line, and in regular order retreated.      <span class="linenum">495</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Many a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Woke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labors.</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet was the air and soft; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys</div>
<div class="verse">Rose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;</div>
<div class="verse">Men came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather,      <span class="linenum">500</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Said that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the Mayflower;</div>
<div class="verse">Talked of their Captain&#8217;s departure, and all the dangers that menaced,</div>
<div class="verse">He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence.</div>
<div class="verse">Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women</div>
<div class="verse">Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.      <span class="linenum">505</span></div>
<div class="verse">Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming:</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful on the sails of the Mayflower riding at anchor,</div>
<div class="verse">Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,      <span class="linenum">510</span></div>
<div class="verse">Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors.</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang</div>
<div class="verse">Loud over field and forest the cannon&#8217;s roar, and the echoes</div>
<div class="verse">Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!      <span class="linenum">515</span></div>
<div class="verse">Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!</div>
<div class="verse">Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!</div>
<div class="verse">Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the seashore,      <span class="linenum">520</span></div>
<div class="verse">Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the Mayflower,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward bound o&#8217;er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Foremost among them was Alden. All night he had lain without slumber,</div>
<div class="verse">Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.</div>
<div class="verse">He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,      <span class="linenum">525</span></div>
<div class="verse">Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur,</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing.</div>
<div class="verse">Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he had turned away, and said: &#8220;I will not awake him;</div>
<div class="verse">Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">530</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet,</div>
<div class="verse">Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning,&mdash;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action.</div>
<div class="verse">But with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him      <span class="linenum">535</span></div>
<div class="verse">Put on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,</div>
<div class="verse">Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber.</div>
<div class="verse">Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,</div>
<div class="verse">Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;      <span class="linenum">540</span></div>
<div class="verse">All the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions;</div>
<div class="verse">But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult.</div>
<div class="verse">So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!      <span class="linenum">545</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the seashore,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a doorstep      <span class="linenum">550</span></div>
<div class="verse">Into a world unknown,&mdash;the corner-stone of a nation!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient</div>
<div class="verse">Lest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,</div>
<div class="verse">Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels      <span class="linenum">555</span></div>
<div class="verse">Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together</div>
<div class="verse">Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered.</div>
<div class="verse">Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,</div>
<div class="verse">One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting.      <span class="linenum">560</span></div>
<div class="verse">He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Standing dejected, among them, unconscious of all that was passing.      <span class="linenum">565</span></div>
<div class="verse">Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,</div>
<div class="verse">Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,</div>
<div class="verse">That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.</div>
<div class="verse">Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!      <span class="linenum">570</span></div>
<div class="verse">Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine!</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Here I remain!&#8221; he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,</div>
<div class="verse">Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.      <span class="linenum">575</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.</div>
<div class="verse">There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghostlike,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection.</div>
<div class="verse">Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!      <span class="linenum">580</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not</div>
<div class="verse">Either your warning or menace, or any omen of evil!</div>
<div class="verse">There is no land so sacred, no air so pure and so wholesome,</div>
<div class="verse">As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps.</div>
<div class="verse">Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence.      <span class="linenum">585</span></div>
<div class="verse">Hover around her forever, protecting, supporting her weakness;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,</div>
<div class="verse">So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,</div>
<div class="verse">Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,      <span class="linenum">590</span></div>
<div class="verse">Walked about on the sands, and the people crowded around him</div>
<div class="verse">Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel.</div>
<div class="verse">Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry,      <span class="linenum">595</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse">Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel!</div>
<div class="verse">Lost in the sound of oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims.</div>
<div class="verse">O strong hearts and true! not one went back in the Mayflower!</div>
<div class="verse">No, not one looked back, who had set his hand to this plowing!      <span class="linenum">600</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors</div>
<div class="verse">Heaving the windlass round, and hoisting the ponderous anchor.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the yards were braced, and all sails set to the west-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing steady and strong; and the Mayflower sailed from the harbor,</div>
<div class="verse">Rounded the point of the Gurnet, and leaving far to the southward      <span class="linenum">605</span></div>
<div class="verse">Island and cape of sand, and the Field of the First Encounter,</div>
<div class="verse">Took the wind on her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,</div>

<div class="indent">Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Much endeared to them all, as something living and human;      <span class="linenum">610</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then, as if tilled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic,</div>
<div class="verse">Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Said, &#8220;Let us pray!&#8221; and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage.</div>
<div class="verse">Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them</div>
<div class="verse">Bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death, and their kindred      <span class="linenum">615</span></div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to awake in their graves, and to join in the prayer that they uttered.</div>
<div class="verse">Sun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean</div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard;</div>
<div class="verse">Buried beneath it lay forever all hope of escaping.</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,       <span class="linenum">620</span></div>
<div class="verse">Watching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,</div>
<div class="verse">Pointing with outstretched hands, and saying, &#8220;Look!&#8221; he had vanished.</div>

<div class="verse">Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows</div>
<div class="verse">Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine,      <span class="linenum">625</span></div>
<div class="verse">Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters.</div>

PRISCILLA.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the loadstone,</div>
<div class="verse">Whatsoever it touches, by subtle laws of its nature,      <span class="linenum">630</span></div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">&#8220;Are you so much offended, you will not speak to me?&#8221; said she.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Am I so much to blame, that yesterday, when you were pleading</div>
<div class="verse">Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?      <span class="linenum">635</span></div>
<div class="verse">Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying</div>
<div class="verse">What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,</div>
<div class="verse">That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble</div>
<div class="verse">Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,      <span class="linenum">640</span></div>
<div class="verse">Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Yesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,      <span class="linenum">645</span></div>
<div class="verse">Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I spake as I did, by an irresistible impulse.</div>
<div class="verse">You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,</div>
<div class="verse">Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:      <span class="linenum">650</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;No!&#8221; interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely.</div>
<div class="verse">It was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman      <span class="linenum">655</span></div>
<div class="verse">Long to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.</div>
<div class="verse">Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women</div>
<div class="verse">Sunless and silent and deep, like subterranean rivers</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Running through caverns of darkness, unheard, unseen, and unfruitful,     <span class="linenum">660</span></div>
<div class="verse">Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always</div>
<div class="verse">More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,      <span class="linenum">665</span></div>
<div class="verse">Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;All, by these words, I can see,&#8221; again interrupted the maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying.</div>
<div class="verse">When from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,</div>
<div class="verse">Frankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,      <span class="linenum">670</span></div>
<div class="verse">Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;</div>
<div class="verse">For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level.      <span class="linenum">675</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly</div>
<div class="verse">If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,</div>
<div class="verse">If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases</div>
<div class="verse">Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,</div>
<div class="verse">But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.&#8221;<span class="linenum">680</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,   </div>
<div class="verse">Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty.</div>
<div class="verse">He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer.</div>
<div class="verse">So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined      <span class="linenum">685</span></div>
<div class="verse">What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things</div>
<div class="verse">Keep ourselves loyal to truth, and the sacred professions of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:</div>
<div class="verse">I have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always.      <span class="linenum">690</span></div>
<div class="verse">So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,      <span class="linenum">695</span></div>
<div class="verse">Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,</div>
<div class="verse">Healed by the touch of that hand, and he said, with a voice full of feeling:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest, and dearest!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Distant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,</div>
<div class="verse">That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.</div>
<div class="verse">But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:<span class="linenum">705</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,      </div>
<div class="verse">Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
<div class="verse">You may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,</div>
<div class="verse">When you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the story,&mdash;      <span class="linenum">710</span></div>
<div class="verse">Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had suffered,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">How he had even determined to sail that day in the Mayflower,      <span class="linenum">715</span></div>
<div class="verse">And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that threatened,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly I thank you for this: how good you have been to me always!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,</div>

<div class="verse">Urged by importunate zeal, and withheld by pangs of contrition;</div>
<div class="verse">Slowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing,</div>

<h3>VII.<br />

THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward,      <span class="linenum2">725</span></div>
<div class="verse">Winding through forest and swamp, and along the trend of the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">All day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger</div>
<div class="verse">Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odor of powder</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort;      <span class="linenum">730</span></div>
<div class="verse">He who was used to success, and to easy victories always,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! &#8217;twas too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his armor!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">&#8220;I alone am to blame,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;for mine was the folly.     <span class="linenum2">735</span></div>
<div class="verse">What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in the harness,</div>
<div class="verse">Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing of maidens?</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Twas but a dream,&mdash;let it pass,&mdash;let it vanish like so many others!</div>
<div class="verse">What I thought was a flower, is only a weed, and is worthless;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Out of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and henceforward      <span class="linenum">740</span></div>
<div class="verse">Be but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,</div>
<div class="verse">While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">After a three days&#8217; march he came to an Indian encampment      <span class="linenum2">745</span></div>
<div class="verse">Pitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the forest;</div>
<div class="verse">Women at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with warpaint,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated about a fire, and smoking and talking together;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and saber and musket,      <span class="linenum">750</span></div>
<div class="verse">Straightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Came to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present;</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred.</div>
<div class="verse">Braves of the tribe were these, and brothers, gigantic in stature,</div>
<div class="verse">Huge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan;      <span class="linenum">755</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<div class="verse">One was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat.</div>
<div class="verse">Round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum,</div>
<div class="verse">Two-edged trenchant knives, with points as sharp as a needle.</div>
<div class="verse">Other arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Welcome, English!&#8221; they said,&mdash;these words they had learned from the traders<span class="linenum">760</span></div>
<div class="verse">Touching at times on the coast, to barter and chaffer for peltries.</div>
<div class="verse">Then in their native tongue they begun to parley with Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Through his guide and interpreter, Hobomok, friend of the white man,</div>
<div class="verse">Begging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and powder,</div>
<div class="verse">Kept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in his cellars,      <span class="linenum">765</span></div>
<div class="verse">Ready to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man!</div>
<div class="verse">But when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:      <span class="linenum">770</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat</div>
<div class="verse">Is not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">But on a mountain, at night, from an oak-tree riven by lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,      <span class="linenum">775</span></div>
<div class="verse">Shouting, &#8216;Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?&#8217;&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Held it aloft and displayed a woman&#8217;s face on the handle,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;      <span class="linenum">780</span></div>
<div class="verse">By-and-by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Then stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">While with his fingers he patted the knife that hung at his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he muttered,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;By-and-by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not!      <span class="linenum">785</span></div>
<div class="verse">This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us!</div>
<div class="verse">He is a little man; let him go and work with the women!&#8221;</div>
</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians</div>
<div class="verse">Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Feigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bowstrings,      <span class="linenum">790</span></div>
<div class="verse">Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush.</div>
<div class="verse">But undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them smoothly;</div>
<div class="verse">So the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers.</div>
<div class="verse">But when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,      <span class="linenum">795</span></div>
<div class="verse">Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples.</div>
<div class="verse">Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from its scabbard,</div>
<div class="verse">Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage</div>
<div class="verse">Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiendlike fierceness upon it.</div>
<div class="verse">Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop,      <span class="linenum">800</span></div>
<div class="verse">And, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December,</div>
<div class="verse">Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the lightning thunder; and death unseen ran before it.</div>
<div class="verse">Frightened, the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket,      <span class="linenum">805</span></div>
<div class="verse">Hotly pursued and beset; but their sachem, the brave Wattawamat,</div>
<div class="verse">Fled not; he was dead. Unswerving and swift had a bullet</div>
<div class="verse">Passed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above them       <span class="linenum2">810</span></div>
<div class="verse">Silent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man.</div>
<div class="verse">Smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and his stature,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Mocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now</div>
<div class="verse">Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!&#8221;      <span class="linenum">815</span></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<div class="verse">When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat</div>
<div class="verse">Scowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church and a fortress,</div>
<div class="verse">All who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage.      <span class="linenum">820</span></div>
<div class="verse">Only Priscilla averted her face from this specter of terror,</div>
<div class="verse">Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Shrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles,</div>
<div class="verse">He should lay claim to her hand, as the prize and reward of his valor.</div>

<div class="indent">So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the autumn,      <span class="linenum2">865</span></div>
<div class="verse">Alden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers,</div>
<div class="verse">As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,</div>
<div class="verse">After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Truly, Priscilla,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when I see you spinning and spinning,</div>
<div class="verse">Never idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others,      <span class="linenum">870</span></div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;</div>
<div class="verse">You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle</div>
<div class="verse">Uttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her fingers;</div>
<div class="verse">While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:      <span class="linenum">875</span></div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;</div>
<div class="verse">She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o&#8217;er valley and meadow and mountain,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
<div class="verse">She was so thrifty and good, that her name passed into a proverb.      <span class="linenum">880</span></div>
<div class="verse">So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer</div>
<div class="verse">Hum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with music.</div>
<div class="verse">Then shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their childhood,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spinner!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden,      <span class="linenum">885</span></div>
<div class="verse">Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest,</div>
<div class="verse">Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering praises of Alden:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives,</div>
<div class="verse">Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands.      <span class="linenum">890</span></div>
<div class="verse">Hold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting;</div>
<div class="verse">Then who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and the manners,</div>
<div class="verse">Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,</div>

<div class="verse">Sometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly</div>
<div class="verse">Twist or knot in the yarn, unawares&mdash;for how could she help it?&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse">But John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow      <span class="linenum">910</span></div>

<div class="verse">Pressing her close to his heart, as forever his own, and exclaiming:</div>

THE WEDDING-DAY.</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Forth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet,        </div>
<div class="verse">Issued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplendent,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,</div>
<div class="verse">Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates.</div>
<div class="verse">Blessing the world he came, and the bars of vapor beneath him      <span class="linenum">930</span></div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.</div>
<div class="verse">Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also</div>
<div class="verse">Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,</div>
<div class="verse">One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.      <span class="linenum">935</span></div>
<div class="verse">Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.</div>
<div class="verse">Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate&#8217;s presence,</div>
<div class="verse">After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.</div>
<div class="verse">Fervently then and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth      <span class="linenum">940</span></div>
<div class="verse">Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,</div>
<div class="verse">Speaking of life and of death, and imploring Divine benedictions.</div>
</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in armor of steel, a somber and sorrowful figure!</div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?      <span class="linenum">945</span></div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a phantom of air,&mdash;a bodiless, spectral illusion?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?</div>
<div class="verse">Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;</div>
<div class="verse">Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression      <span class="linenum">950</span></div>
<div class="verse">Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,</div>
<div class="verse">As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud</div>
<div class="verse">Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.</div>
<div class="verse">Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,</div>
<div class="verse">As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.      <span class="linenum">955</span></div>
<div class="verse">But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement</div>
<div class="verse">Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!</div>
<div class="verse">Grasping the bridegroom&#8217;s hand, he said with emotion, &#8220;Forgive me!</div>
<div class="verse">I have been angry and hurt,&mdash;too long have I cherished the feeling;      <span class="linenum">960</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<div class="verse">I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.</div>
<div class="verse">Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error.</div>
<div class="verse">Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the bridegroom: &#8220;Let all be forgotten between us,&mdash;      <span class="linenum">965</span></div>
<div class="verse">All save the dear old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Gravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,</div>
<div class="verse">Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.      <span class="linenum">970</span></div>
<div class="verse">Then he said with a smile: &#8220;I should have remembered the adage,&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">If you would be well served, you must serve yourself, and, moreover,</div>
<div class="verse">No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Great was the people&#8217;s amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to behold once more the sunburnt face of their Captain,      <span class="linenum">975</span></div>
<div class="verse">Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,</div>
<div class="verse">Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,      <span class="linenum">980</span></div>
<div class="verse">Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.</div>
<div class="verse">Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;      <span class="linenum">985</span></div>
<div class="verse">There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;</div>
<div class="verse">But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,      <span class="linenum2">990</span></div>
<div class="verse">Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted.</div>
<div class="verse">Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,</div>
<div class="verse">Alden, the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought out the snow-white bull, obeying the hand of its master,      <span class="linenum">995</span></div>
<div class="verse">Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.</div>
<div class="verse">She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;</div>
<div class="verse">Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,<span class="linenum">1000</span></div>
<div class="verse">Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,      </div>
<div class="verse">Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Nothing is wanting now,&#8221; he said with a smile, &#8220;but the distaff;</div>
<div class="verse">Then you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent">Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,        <span class="linenum3">1005</span></div>
<div class="verse">Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.</div>
<div class="verse">Pleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through its bosom,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Tremulous, floating in air, o&#8217;er the depths of the azure abysses,</div>
<div class="verse">Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors,      <span class="linenum">1010</span></div>
<div class="verse">Gleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them suspended,</div>
<div class="verse">Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and fir-tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.</div>
<div class="verse">Like a picture it seemed of the primitive pastoral ages,</div>
<div class="verse">Fresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and Isaac,      <span class="linenum">1015</span></div>
<div class="verse">Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always,</div>
<div class="verse">Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers,</div>

leather prepared there.</p>

<p>8. <i>Corselet.</i> A breastplate and backpiece forming a protection for
the upper part of the body.</p>

<p><span class="indent"><i>Sword of Damascus.</i></span> Damascus in Syria is one of the oldest
cities in the world. The swords made here were once famous not
only for their remarkably fine temper, but for the artistic figures
and mystic characters wrought in the blade. The secret of their make
is now largely a lost art.</p>

<p>1-20. Miles Standish was at this time about thirty-six years of
age, though the description seems to make him older. He had evidently
left England for the Netherlands to fight with the Dutch
against Spain. In Holland he had met his compatriots, the Puritans,
cast his fortunes with them, and embarked as one of their number
for the New World. John Alden, at this time about twenty-one, had
joined the Pilgrims when their vessel touched at the port of Southampton.</p>

<p>19. &#8220;While yet an abbot, Gregory&#8217;s interest had been awakened
by the fair faces and flaxen hair of a group of Saxon youths exposed
for sale in the slave-market at Rome. &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; he asked.
&#8216;Angles,&#8217; was the reply. &#8216;It suits them well,&#8217; he said; &#8216;with faces so
angel-like.&#8217;&#8221; (<i>Painter, History of English Literature.</i>)</p>

<p>20. <i>The Mayflower.</i> The name of the vessel that carried the Pilgrims
to America.</p>

<p>28. <i>Arcabucero.</i> A Spanish word, originally meaning archer, now
generally equivalent to musketeer.</p>

<p>22-33. The pictures given of their personal appearance is completed
and reinforced by the first words the two men speak. Compare
the character indications of 25-30 and 32, 33.</p>

<p>52. <i>Sagamore</i>, <i>sachem</i>. These words are the titles of Indian
chiefs, the former being a subordinate, the latter a principal chief.</p>

Standish.&#8217; In William Bradford&#8217;s <i>History of Plymouth Plantation</i>

his servant dyed the first winter. Only his dougter Priscilla survived,
and maried with John Alden.&#8221; (Bradford&#8217;s <i>History of Plymouth
Plantation</i>.)</p>

<p>100. <i>Iberian.</i> Iberia, Spain. This was, however, an Alpine village.
As Cæsar and his companions were passing through the place,
they were struck with its poverty and wretchedness. Some one
mockingly asked whether there were any canvassing for offices there.
To this Cæsar replied: &#8220;For my part, I would rather be the first
among these fellows than the second man in Rome.&#8221; The account is
given in Plutarch&#8217;s <i>Life of Caesar</i>.</p>

<p>104. <i>Flanders.</i> Allusion to Cæsar&#8217;s campaign against the Nervii,
who occupied that part of the Netherlands known as Flanders.</p>

in America to a trailing plant &#8220;having white or rose-colored

the vicinity of Plymouth, and was the first flower that greeted the

<p>232. Many English books and translations were printed by the
early Dutch printers of Amsterdam and Leyden, notably by the
Elzivirs of the latter place.</p>

<p>245. Compare Luke ix: 62.</p>

<p>248. Jeremiah xxxiii: 11.</p>

<p>321. In Young&#8217;s <i>Chronicles of the Pilgrims</i> we read that the
ancestors of Miles Standish were of a warlike spirit, and that the
family record can be traced back as far as to Ralph de Standish, 1221.</p>

<p>324. <i>Crest.</i> The distinguishing mark worn by a knight, usually
upon the helmet or above the shield.</p>

<p><span class="indent3"><i>Argent.</i></span> Silver, or resembling silver.</p>

<p>325. <i>Gules.</i> Of a red color.</p>

<p>362. The account is given in 2 Samuel, xi and xii.</p>

<p>415. <i>Wat Tyler.</i> The leader of an insurrection in London, slain
by Jean Standuich. This happened under Richard II., about 1381.</p>

<p>421. <i>You too, Brutus!</i> Notwithstanding the friendship existing
between them, Brutus conspired against the life of Cæsar. It is
stated that when Brutus advanced to strike him, Cæsar said, &#8220;And
you too, my son!&#8221;</p>

<p>442. <i>Elder of Plymouth.</i> William Brewster (1560-1644).</p>

<p>481. In this dramatic incident the poet has used the facts as they
occurred, with very little change. The incident of the rattlesnake-skin
and the challenge is historic; it took place in 1622.</p>

<p>496. The plot requires that the choleric Captain should at this
stage be removed from the presence of Alden and Priscilla, leaving
the issue in a state of suspense. For this purpose the author finds
the material of the annals almost ready shaped. The only alteration
required was to change the time when the expedition under Standish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
started to relieve the threatened Weymouth Colony. This took place
in March, 1623, but in the poem it is made to happen in April, 1621.</p>

<p>559. Alden&#8217;s position with one foot on the gunwale and one on
the rock is a striking visualization of a mood.</p>

gates.&#8221; (<i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book II, 853.)</p>

<p>597. The shipmaster, like Standish, is not a devout Puritan.</p>

<p>601. <i>Songs.</i> Not songs, but rather a series of rhythmic sounds
accompanying their work.</p>

<p>605. <i>Gurnet Point.</i> A headland at the entrance to Plymouth
harbor, on the north side.</p>

<p>606. Before landing at Plymouth the Pilgrims had spent some
time in looking for a suitable locality. A party of them had gone
on shore and examined the environs here. They had then met some
Indians; hence the name, &#8220;First Encounter.&#8221;</p>

<p>607. <i>Took the wind on her quarter.</i> Holding a course such that
the wind struck the vessel at a point &#8220;between abeam and astern.&#8221;
What must have been the exact course of the vessel?</p>

<p>626. <i>Like the spirit of God.</i> Reference to Genesis i: 2.</p>

<p>657. <i>Dissolves the spell of its silence.</i> Old superstition. So in
Hamlet, (Act I, sc. 1, l. 44,) where Bernardo says, &#8220;It [the ghost]
would be spoke to.&#8221;</p>

<p>665. <i>Havilah.</i> Genesis ii: 10-14.</p>

<p>755. <i>Goliath of Gath.</i> 1 Sam. xvii: 14.</p>

<p><span class="indent3"><i>Og, king of Bashan.</i></span> Numbers xxi: 33.</p>

<p>815. The details of this expedition and the resulting encounter
are taken from Winslow&#8217;s <i>Relation of Standish&#8217;s Expedition</i> as given
in Dr. Young&#8217;s <i>Chronicles</i>. Here we are informed that such an
expedition took place in 1623, under command of Captain Standish.
Other details worked into the poem are also mentioned here: the
defiance of Wattawmat (771-781); Pecksuot (783-787); the observation
of Hobomak (813-815); and the grim trophy placed by
the Captain on the roof of the fort when he returned to the colony.</p>

<p>828. <i>Merestead.</i> &#8220;Meer&#8221; and &#8220;mear&#8221; are old terms, meaning
boundary. Hence, the plot of ground inclosed by boundaries.</p>

<p>829. <i>Glebe.</i> Sod or turf.</p>

<p>846. The original homestead is still owned by the descendants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
John Alden. It is in Duxbury, on the coast, a short distance southeast
from Boston.</p>

note what difference it would have made with respect to a satisfactory
outcome if the Captain had appeared before the service
began.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
